# ML_from_scratch
In this repository, we will be exploring the implementations of the Multi-layer Perceptron, Random Forest, and PCA algorithms using Julia.

Current, all algorithms have been implemented and are currently working. Note I have also implemented the Adam optimiser in order to train the Multilayer Perceptron

Note: The content of this repository was made with reference to a project I completed alongside my colleague Simon Lehnerer while at UCL
